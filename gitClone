Explain what git clone does, in your own words

To be used like: git clone *url here*

Allows a user to clone a git repository to their own machine.

Origin will be set to the original repository.

git pushes to origin will move content from the users machine back to the original repo.

Clone will keep the directory name unless you specify otherwise.

You will inherit all commits of the origin repo.
